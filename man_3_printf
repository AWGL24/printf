.B #include "main.h"
.nf
.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.fi
.P
Here we analize through the formal printing every character one by one also cheking if we find any format modifier.
If we do end up finding a format modifier, we pass the character after the escape character to the fuction called case_select.

.P
This is a custom implementation of putchar that prints using write and returns 1 if it prints something.

.P
This is a custom implementation of puts that is used to write a line or string to the oputput stream (stdout)
does not include the null character. It does not append a new line and return an interger.

Uses recursion to print one by one the passed int and returns the amount of numbers printed,
if it finds a negative number converts it to positive and adds the character '-' in front of it.
