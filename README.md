# The _printf function

## Description

Our printf function works exactly the same as the printf function in the **C programming language**. 
Anything that works in the **printf** function found in the C programming will work here as well.

### What is printf?
The printf function in C language: In C programming language, printf() function **is used to print the (“character, string, float, integer, octal and hexadecimal values”)** onto the output screen. We use printf() function with %d format specifier to display the value of an integer variable.

Our **function** is successfully compiled and executed and should return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte). Should this function fail at any time, this function will return `-1` and `(null)` if the string argument is NULL
## Prototype

 - **Format** is a string of characters. The format string is composed of zero or more directives
 - Return: The amount of characters printed excpet the null byte.
 - Write output to stdout, the standard output stream
 - For more info `man 3 printf`

## Compilation
Our code is compiled like this.

## Testing

### main.c file test
We've made a main.c file were you are able to test the program to see if our custom printf function works!

## Output
Your should look like this after the compilation process is finished.

## Bugs
No bugs have beene found in our custom printf function as of this time.
